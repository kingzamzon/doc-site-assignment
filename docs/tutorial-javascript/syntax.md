# Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

```js
// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;
```

## JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- Fixed values
- Variable values

Fixed values are called **Literals**.

Variable values are called **Variables**.

## JavaScript Literals

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:

```js
10.5;

1001;
```

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

```js
"John Doe";

"John Doe";
```

## JavaScript Variables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

```js
let x;
x = 6;
```

## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( `+` `-` `*` `/` ) to compute values:

```js
(5 + 6) * 10;
```

JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

```js
let x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;
```

## JavaScript Expressions

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 \* 10 evaluates to 50:

```js
5 * 10;
```

Expressions can also contain variable values:

```js
x * 10;
```

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":

```js
"John" + " " + "Doe";
```

## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:

```js
let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
```

The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables:

```js
var x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
```
