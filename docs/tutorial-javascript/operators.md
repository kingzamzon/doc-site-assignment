# operators

The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

```js
let x = 10;
```

```js
// Assign the value 5 to x
let x = 5;
// Assign the value 2 to y
let y = 2;
// Assign the value x + y to z:
let z = x + y;
```

The **Addition Operator** (`+`) adds numbers:

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
```

The **Multiplication Operator** (`*`) multiplies numbers.

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;
```

## Types of JavaScript Operators

There are different types of JavaScript operators:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Conditional Operators
- Type Operators

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

**Arithmetic Operators** are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

```js
let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a;
```

| Operator | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                     |
| -        | Subtraction                  |
| \*       | Multiplication               |
| \*\*     | Exponentiation (ES2016)      |
| /        | Division                     |
| %        | Modulus (Division Remainder) |
| ++       | Increment                    |
| --       | Decrement                    |

## JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

The Addition Assignment Operator (`+=`) adds a value to a variable.

```js
let x = 10;
x += 5;
```

| Operator | Example   | Same As      |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ |
| =        | x = y     | x = y        |
| +=       | x += y    | x = x + y    |
| -=       | x -= y    | x = x - y    |
| \*=      | x \*= y   | x = x \* y   |
| /=       | x /= y    | x = x / y    |
| %=       | x %= y    | x = x % y    |
| \*\*=    | x \*\*= y | x = x \*\* y |
